1,
10,A year later, I'm touched by the poster. I think the impact of a singer's life and songs is hugeI don't think anyone can beat Kim Hojung's voice as the best instrument in the world
1,It's a piece that I personally couldn't touch it
1,The worst... ㅜㅜ

1,It's fun. It's really fun

10,It's so touching no matter how many times I see it Kim Hojung's voice is the best I can't wait to be discharged from the army
10,It's a movie that can't let go of Kim Ho-jung's songs and expressions that are more than expected and sincere. It's a movie that makes you fall into it to the point where you feel sorry that the movie is short.
10,The fan meeting of Kibhojung singer was sold out in 3 minutes after the opening of Pyo-ae. I was so touched because it was a nyeonghwa that contained Kim Ho-jung's unique voice, singing ability, and love for fans. Moreover, there must have been a lot of difficulties due to COVID-19, but it was more meaningful because it was held successfully with the cooperation of fans and solid quarantine. It was the first point of contact for a singer to meet fans and fans only, but even though they couldn't shout or sing along, it ended in a disciplined and orderly manner, so I think it was a really successful fan meeting. It's a shame that the singer's sound didn't capture the singer's voice when he sang. The fans' fan sentiment and the singer's sincerity are fully captured on the screen, so it's touching and touching to see. Isn't it the beginning of making this kind of pen meeting movie in Korea??? I don't think I saw this kind of movie before.If so, I think it was a meaningful and great attempt in the history of Korean movies.  Kim Hojung, I hope you live happily while communicating with your fans foreverFighting?
10,It was really hard for me to go to the army Kim Hojung. But I saw your performance in a movie. At first, I cried a lot at the theater with my family and acquaintances. Now I am so happy and thankful that I can see you on TV I'll always be there for you I'm waiting.
10,I felt overwhelmed by singer Kim Ho-joong's skills.    It was the first time for a singer to melt his emotions so that no matter which song he sang, he was sincere, and I was moved throughout the whole time when his sincerity was conveyed.  The singer is standing on stage alone, and it will be difficult to see a singer who is so full on stage and seems to watch a musical for every song he sings.There is no doubt that he will shine brighter after his discharge, and he is an artist who is anticipated and anticipated
10,Star of Aris! Lovely and reliable singer Kim Hojung who calls us family!!!Thank you for you. I will live because of you. Face genius, voice genius, personality genius.

1,No fun, no fun, no fun, no fun, no fun
10,Kim Hojung, who is precious and precious, I was touched enough on TV because I couldn't meet her at the concert hall Thank you.
8,We shot the movie really beautifully I have a feeling.I'm not a fan of Kim Hojung, but I watched it with my mom and it was touching to see her interacting with her fans. I think it's so nice that the people who couldn't go can watch the movie at home.But one thing that's unfortunate is that some of the fans who interviewed do chin masks and do mouth-to-mouth interviews, and I think we had to follow the policy that allowed us to watch the concert by keeping a distance between seats in the concert hall.  That way, we can all enjoy a safe cultural life.  Anyway, I enjoyed the movie.

10,I couldn't express all the heavy emotions that touched my heart while watching it with my friend twice, so I went alone again. No one was conscious of it, but I was immersed in the movie, became a singer's heart, and then Aris' heart, and repeated it, and the screening time was disappointing because I was moved.

10,
10,I watched it with my grandmother, and I was scolded for holding back my tears, and I could feel both emotion and fun.

10,
10,
10,A groundbreaking project!He was flexible and fresh in the situation of the times, and above all, he was able to digest and impress because he was the genre of "Kim Ho-joong."Compared to ordinary or confusing ordinary movies, there is a strong impression and lingering feelings.Music video + concert + Tvarotti + ARIS = Infinite touching!

Looking at the screen X screen, it's more lively and feels like I'm at the scene. I'm looking forward to the release of VOD and Blu-ray as a movie that I want to watch and listen to.
10,It was so touchingIt's a documentary that makes you cry and laugh
10,KIM HOJOONG's song heals my heart and touches my heart
10,Singer Kim Ho-joong, who makes and pulls off all genres of songs, is a real singer. He is so into singing skills that surpasses idol singers that he can't get out of I felt the time was short, so my eyes were wet, so I felt like I saw a great and wonderful concert  As expected, Kim Hojung!

10,It's a movie that made me feel the singer's sincerity and sincerity, and his song was magnificent enough to give me goosebumps, and I felt like I was watching a musical for each song.
10,Just listening to one song from Heaven Reunion, it's like watching it live on Screen X. It was a better music experience than most concerts ~I've seen it on a small TV when I went to the concert hall, so I strongly recommend Screen X because it has high-quality resolution and sound I couldn't see Kim Hojung's voice and sound I want to go to the end of the show several times, so I'm trying to control my mind Kim Hojung's new song has two songs, so even though it's more expensive than regular movies, I felt that it's very cost effective I heard that it was designed to screen X from the planning stage, but the combination of the power of state-of-the-art facilities and the voice of the king of singing power was great, so there was something better than the scene. For those who haven't seen it yet, I strongly recommend that you feel the synergy between Screen X and singing ability Especially, Kim Ho-joong's expression and emotions were captured in the movie. There were a lot of people crying at the scene. The music video that you won't be able to watch when fall is over. If you watch it once, you won't be able to see it once
10,Kim Ho-joong's song "The Heavenly Reunion" was so impressive and touching that the movie cost was not a waste The unrivaled national singer was born!
10,Kim Hojung, "Thank You So" was the best live performance of the fan meeting. I'm touched that I can see and feel all the genres in the stormy song, and I'm completely fascinated by Kim Ho-joong's charm with the affectionate emotions that no other singer can see and feel. The stormy voice made me feel a great sense of realism on the screen
10,Thank you Kim Hojung. I watched it with my daughter in Songpa because there was no screen x theater in my area I was touched that Kim Hojung's singing skills were totally into my heart I wanted to see it again, and even though the screen stopped, all the visitors couldn't get up from their seats, so we all felt the same way, so it was a time that was deeply engraved
10,It was so touchingThank you. Fighting!
10,It was a great production where the singer sang right in front of her in three dimensionsI think I can even touch my face if I stretch out my hand.Touching from the sound! The joy that I felt for the first time! Forever my singer! Kim Hojung! I love you!
10,It's new to watch the movie twice, and I think it's good to watch it again

In the movie, Kim Ho-joong seems to have a magical power that shakes the heart of his natural sensibility into the songI went there without an alternative drawing, but I sang the Cheonjaengjaehoe in a way that seemed like I could die like any reporter's comment, and it was a shock that I felt deeply moved by the audience·A singer who can express emotions at that age by living 50 years. I reported it to 30 singers

10,Kim Hojung's song is the best!His voice echoing through the screen X is fantasticHow can you sing so well with so many different voices?  It's amazing and touching!
10,It's not just a movie. In a documentary style, the fan meeting site, Kim Ho-jung's fan meeting preparation process, singing, and passion for music were captured on the screen. Especially, the song and screen on the 270-degree screen X overwhelm the grandeur as if watching a concert on the spot. How far is the spectrum of Kim Hojung's songs?

10,At first, I watched it with my younger brother, and at the second time, I took my mom, who is over 80 years old, and she was mistaken as if she came to the concert hall, so she claps and is moved every time the song ends.I'm so proud of myself!Thanks to your extension, I feel like I've been a little filial to my mom

1,I want to write this and that, but I want to say that grace is precious
10,
10,The touching fan meeting music video is so touching I'm rooting for Kim Hojung
10,Kim Ho-joong sings all 13 songs. It's like a concert. The sound is so good and the video quality is amazing. It's different from regular movies because it's screen x production from the beginning. It was just like we were at a concert on set. It's amazing.
10,I watched it again because it lingered for a long time after watching it.  I liked all the great songs In particular, I got goosebumps all over my body during the reunion.  A natural singer with sophisticated stage manners.
10,It is a movie like a comprehensive gift set with various genres of music and stage manners. It's a wave of emotions Even if I look at it again, it was a new feeling as if it was my first time seeing it I really want to see you again
10,My son and I watched a moving movie together. I watched it twice with my friend
10,It was touching to see Kim Ho-joong's backstage, sincere and warm voice and facial expressions. Scenes that you couldn't see at the fan meeting!I'm touched!
10,It's fun and touching. I got both rabbits  The movie that shows the true value of Kim Ho-joong, communicating with fans with high-quality singing and sensitive emotions, was also great
10,
10,I was fascinated by Screen X's sense of realism and grandeur. I was touched by Kim Hojung's live musicI watched it again, but I want to watch it again~~It's more than expected because of its good production and planning ability~~~

10,Kim Hojung's fan meeting. I'm tearing up. I'm always rooting for you. Be successful!
10,As a singer, the song is so good and the directing is amazing The story is also very touching!  And the feeling of seeing it at the concert and the movie theater was so fancy I was amazed!
10,I'm so touched Kim Hojung, thank you so much
10,I watched it three times in the middle of CGV Incheon  The story, progress, and sound are accurate, and I'm satisfied with Kim Hojung's loud voice and screen  I'm going to watch it one more time and my acquaintances and son who went with me are very satisfied
10,It's so touchingI'm a little short of 5 pointsIt's the best if there are two vocal parts. That's a bummer~~
10,I watched it twice in Screen X.2D, and I was even more touched by Screen X. Tears that flow with emotion every time I see them. The friend I went with doesn't watch TV that much, so he doesn't know you well, but he keeps raising his thumb I'm going to watch it for the third time
10,
10,Tvarotti Kim Ho-joong said, "Thank you so much." While watching the movie, it was so cool and touching. I visited CGV for the first time in my life and watched it. It was so good to see the screen X 2D. Please allow me to watch such a luxurious movie once during the holidays. ^^ Please make sure.

10,
10,Kim Hojung, thank you. I'm so touched I healed my melancholy heart with my cool singing skills I liked the behind-the-scenes stories that you didn't usually see. I want to watch it again
10,I didn't know that the day would come when my mom would like to listen to music. I watched it with her because she said she wanted to watch it. It was better than I thought Kim Ho-joong, you're a great singer^^ Please play good songs for a long time and continue to be a beloved singer!
10,It was as if we were at the concert hall together. It was our third time watching it, but I think we should watch it again before the end.
10,
10,I felt with my heart that every scene was sincere
10,
10,Kim Hojung's fan meeting performance was so touching I was able to capture the vividness of that day on the 4D screen, and I was moved 100 times more by the perfect sound and singer Kim Hojung's sincerity I'm rooting for you until the end
10,Kim Hojung's song is the best!
10,Even if you keep looking at it, it still lingers, so you go see it again
10,It's so touching every time I see itI'm going to go to Centum for room 8
10,I can feel the shivers in my body. It's so touching
10,I watched it on the first day of the actual fan meeting. I was curious about the behind-the-scenes story and the atmosphere of the fan meeting on the last day, and I wanted to meet Byul again, so I watched it as a movie. I cried so hard throughout the movie. It was a precious time where I could truly feel the warm and wide heart of our stars. Our Kim Hojung star, please finish your social service well. I'll be waiting carefully. I love you. ^^
10,It was so touching like a concert·As expected, the sound was different when I watched it in the theater·A handkerchief is a must·Make sure to take it·I'm sure there's not a single person who hasn't seen it~~
10,I've watched it a few times already, but I think it's the best video with a vivid sense of realism. I'm getting the best deep echo
2,
10,Watching Kim Hojung's heavenly voice on screen x was the first and touching experience   It was a great memory
10,What are the people who are saying it's mean?During Chuseok, the mother of OO Fan's mother, OOO Fancy's mother invited us.Hojung said he sings so well and stole tears from time to time. He was moved and fell in love with it.Anyone can tell that the emotion and the echo are not different.It's a pity for the haters. Let's live positively!
10,KIM HOJOONG, thank you. I want to be touched again
10,It's the best! I'm touched by Kim Ho-joong's human side as well as his singing ability!He's always been a man who can't sleep. I love him!KIM HOJOONG, forever!
10,I was able to feel the emotions of the fan meeting through Screen X.KIM HOJOONG, KIM HOJOONG, KIM HOJOONG, and ARIS, forever
10,The movie was so good. I've seen it five times. The more I see it, the more I get moved. I could feel singer Kim Ho-joong's singing ability, passion and sincerity, and I was even more moved because it was a movie made with fans.
10,There are a lot of malicious comments here, too. You leave a review after watching this movie? It's something to laugh about. Don't insult me for being a singer and post a review on The Movie. Thank you for the different scale. I watched the second one in 2D, but the second one was more touching. It's like a concert. It's like a video sound and a story. It's a sincere interview with fans. It was the best movie
1,It's inevitable that there's three coincidences, and there's no smoke in the chimney, and there's a good reason why the controversy continues, and the cicadas are so engrossed in it's scary It's going to happen
10,Who do you think you'll be able to sing.You can't compare... You're so human. You're so touched.good!!
10,I've seen it three times, but it still lingers. I'll have to go watch it again. You'll regret it if you don't watch it on Screen X.
10,I'm so touched. How much I cried while watching. Not to mention my singing skills
10,I saw it on screen X at Songpa CGV, but the screen, sound, and direction are all good. The stage is on the front and the concert seats are on both sides, which is touching. For Screen X, I recommend medium plus minus. That's how it spreads out in my view and it's much more vivid. Like Kim Ho-joong, a music video movie needs to have a powerful voice to double the emotions
10,Kim Hojung's song on Screen X is touching
10,There are interviews in between, so it's even more touching. I can feel your sincerity when you sing and interview. It felt like you were at a fan meeting. It felt like your own concert. It was so newIt's touching
10,Thank you. I was sad that I couldn't go to the fan meeting, but it was really touching I laughed, cried, and cheered with the people next to me
10,A singer's life is the best singing ability and touching human story. If you read and appreciate the book, you'll feel more touchedI hope that the weak young people these days learn the spirit of challenging themselves against adversity like Kim Ho-joongI strongly support and support Kim Hojung's future

10,Thank you, I could see various aspects of Kim Ho-jum in the movie, and I can't like the voice that everyone admitsIf you haven't seen it, please listen to it
10,
1,In my life...That's not right

10,I was more moved than I expected. Especially, from the moment I heard the first song, I held hands and watched the movie without moving until the end.I'm not bored. I've seen it twice. I felt different from the two times. Kim Hojung, do well. I wanted to cheer for you because I could see your sincerity

1,It was a waste of time. I like Lim Young Woong better
10,I was surprised by the realistic grandeur of CGV Screen X (3 sides, 270°) with the whole family, and I realized the popular genre of his unique charm, and his values and affection for music were conveyed by 2-5 times more admiration, emotion, and emotion^^

I lost track of time and enjoyed watching it. It lingers in my mind and makes me want to see it again.I strongly recommend that you show the concert vibe.

After listening to the song, I think I'll become Kim Ho-joong's fan The music is still ringing in my earsI'm rooting for you, Hojung!

1,If you're a fan of Kim Hojung's grandmother over 50, I recommend it
10,I was so happy and moved to see Kim Ho-joong's first fan meeting movie, "You, Thank You So." Kim Ho-joong's song, which sings each verse with all his heart in a heavenly voice, penetrated my heart. Even now, the impression of that time still remains and makes me happy.
10,The immersion of the lyrics delivered by the singer, sincerity, and excellent singing ability are immersed in the delicate emotional expression that no one can encounter.So we laugh together, we cry together, and my way feels like an indicator of my life. It's a movie with a great stage and story. The more I see it, the more touching it gets.
10,
10,As soon as the movie is over, I miss you more. I feel sad.I was excited to watch it twice as I came out of the theater, but since it's being extended, I should go watch it again before it's over.My heart is filled with excitement as if I were in my first love.
10,It was a really touching movie.I want to see you again.I love you more than I do.
10,It was a really happy time.Drenched in Kim Ho-joong's warm emotional voice~~♡ We support greater honor and blessings by staying with you until the end.
10,It's my first time to watch the same movie in my life! Kim Ho-jung, thank you. I was so touched that I could feel the tension and catharsis of the concert hall on screen X. For those who didn't see it, I strongly recommend you to watch it
10,It felt like the sound was right thereI was touched and healed
10,My husband and I who joined the pen cafe went to see each other in the morning. Although not an official pen, my husband once said that even though Eunyeon Middle School and Kim Ho Middle School are good, they are very good In the song that resonates in a more quiet space in the morning, deep inside my heart, I felt emotional, and when I glanced at my side eyes, my husband was also wiping his eyes  It's been an hour and a half with the light of three sides and a wave of music floating through the night sea How desperately you sing in the singer's shadowy face I'd rather have a strong impression as if I saw a scream of life To my potential fan, my husband, who shared beautiful memories on a beautiful autumn day
10,It was Kim Hojung's "Thank you so much."It was my first time seeing the fan meeting movie, but Kim Hojung's heavenly reunion with a 180 degree screen almost took my breath away!The Japanese couple who went together praised Kim Ho-joong's music world for its different scale!
4,The music video is well made But why beautify a gangster?And why is the night of humans who don't die ruined?
10,Kim Hojung's first fan meeting. I loved the overwhelming screen like watching the live broadcast
10,The overwhelming scale is still in 3D that feels like we're in a great direct concert hall
10,The overwhelming 3D screen that shows Kim Hojung's true self was touching
10,I could not even think of going to the fan meeting, so I always felt empty, so I watched it for the fifth time from the day of release to the reservation...Every time I see it, I'm moved by the song, the story, and every time I see it, I'm moved by it as if I've never seen it before
10,I really liked the overwhelming 3D screen footage It feels like I'm listening to a song on the set of a singer
10,The singer's voice is at the highest level when he sings emotionally like this way.
10,It's a movie for fans. Of course, even if you are not a fan, you can understand your fan sentiment more if you go together when your family is a fan of (mostly your mother) Kim Ho-joong. After watching this movie, my image of Hojung Kim became better. In fact, I liked Kim Ho-joong's appearance in interviews because he was quite honest. I hope that the agency and other officials really value the singers and fans.  And I sincerely hope that this singer only walks on flower roads. In the future, I hope that the passionate (mother) fans will enjoy listening to the singer's songs for a long time by completing their military service without any problems and walking on flower paths.
10,Kim Hojung, thank you. The moment I watched the movie at Screen x theater, I felt so ecstatic. It was touching to see the artist's true side, such as the song and the backstage story that resonated magnificently ~ Life is the energy! "Fan ID," where endorphins are constantly coming out, we're going to watch it for the fifth time while cheering for you I hope many people know what you really areFighting!
10,
10,I was amazed by Park Chan's loveliness and singing ability, and I watched it with tears and runny nose.

10,I watched it with my husband at first, and I was touched by Kim Ho-joong's sincere expression, warm heart, and stormy singing skills that seemed to pierce the ceiling How happy I was to be able to watch it with my daughter again on the last day of the local screening Even her daughter, who wasn't particularly interested, moved her to tears~Kim Hojung, who always sings with all his heart, is the best musician who shivers Tvarotti listeners with great emotion. I love and support you forever
10,
10,The whole family watched it.It was so touching. They say they now understand why people say that they are comforted and healed by Kim Ho-jung's songs, saying that they felt emotional watching both their sons in their 20s and daughters in their 30s. Young people feel the same way. Anyway, it was so touching.
1,If you turn on the TV, it's voice trot, but even movies... Ah.
6,To be honest, we have to evaluate objectively.Well, I honestly don't think my score is that high. I seriously considered it.
10,Once you look at it, you can feel the sincerity of the movie star that you can't help but fall in love with.Actor Kim Hojung!
10,I loved the video and sound that delivered the liveliness of the fan meeting
10,It's so touching Kim Hojung is the best! His songs are the best!
10,An hour and a half passed by in a blink of an eye and I was mesmerized by the reality as if I were at KBS Arena.
1,Live me.
10,After a long time, I went to the movie theater with my friend to see you and the movie theater changed a lot It's really been a few years Thanks to Hojung, my best friend was Penn, another singer After watching the movie, my friend said that he is really good at singing and let me listen to good songs. Thank you, so I went to Kyobo Bookstore and bought two CDs to buy one uncle and one friend I had dinner with you again It was such a fun day I feel like I'm writing a diaryL
1,You can't glorify a gang
10,I can feel the warmth from the title. While listening to Kim Ho-joong's various genres of songs, I thought I was happy to meet such a good singer in a movie. I hope many people can watch this movie together. Thank you.
10,KIM HOJOONG's songs are amazing. Singing skills, interpreting songs! Even non-fans are amazed by the seriousness of the singer's music and singing. It's still cute like they're in their 20s. It's fun. The lyrics and notes are amazing. It's heartwarming I think that a big singer appeared this year. I was surprised by his creative breakthrough this year.

I had high expectations, but it was more touching than that.  Thank you so much to the artists who produced high quality videos and compositions.  It was a happy time.

1,Singing movie is ridiculous
10,I was mesmerized by Kim Ho-joong's song, which overwhelms the audience.In particular, I wanted to watch the movie two or three times because it was too sad to see the grand singer's song once while watching it at Screen X Hall. Thank you so much for planning this.
10,
10,
10,I was touched from the first screen.The star in the 3D screen, which was filled with three pages, came out close to the stage and thought it was like singing a song only for me.Thank you. Thank you.
10,I think people who don't know Kim Hojung will fall in love with the song. It feels like I went to a good concert on an autumn day.

10,I watched the Nth episode. It was perfect to hear Kim Ho-joong's precious voice in a big space with three-dimensional sound. It was nice to be able to hear sounds that were too luxurious to be captured on a smartphone or computer in a proper setting. Touching, comforting, joy, love!
10,I couldn't keep my mouth shut because of the cool and mournful singing. It felt like I went to see a concert. Kim Hojung, do well. It was perfect.
10,I was at the last concert, but I liked it more because there was a new behind-the-scenes story about the singer. I watched it twice on the 29th and 3rd, and the more I see it, the more I feel moved. I'm going to go see it again in a few days.If you haven't watched it, make sure to watch it
10,It feels like I'm at a concert, not a movie theater.Kim Hojung's songs are touching. If you haven't seen it, I recommend it. a decent movie bill

10,It gives a gentle impression.
10,
10,Watch it on Screen X I miss you again
10,The moment you can sing the song that was the reason for your existence, the singer has everything in the world. The most valuable of them will be fans who only support themselves. It is the birth of a singer who will write a great history in Korean music history. Kim Hojung as an empty body!
10,Touching, directing, video, story, etc.Time flies with a solid configuration.But if there's anything to be desired, it's a short time.
10,
10,I'm still moved
10,Everything was good. It's a day when Kim Ho-joong gets better. I highly recommend it.
10,Kim Ho-joong is the star of the Korean trot world. I'll grow the most. I hope you prepare step by step so that you can perform like Na Hoon-a.
10,I watched it yesterday in Pangyo CGV and today in Daegu Wolseong CGV. It's such a waste to watch once. There was no movie theater near my house, so I drove 105 kilometers and came to watch it again today. If there is a movie theater nearby, I want to go to work every day. My grandmother in her 70s came to see me for 5 days in a row. I strongly recommend it.
10,I haven't been to the fan meeting, but through the movie, I felt like I was with themI was able to fall in love with Kim Ho-joong's songs and I was touched by his sincerity in singingIt was the best time for me
2,I didn't get to see it properly because I was sleepy

10,Thank you so much. It was very touching.Thank you to everyone who produced this movie.Each line of Hojung's song shook my heartstrings and made me feel sad. It was so nice to see you on screen X
10,It was the best to listen to Kim Ho-joong's unrivaled song with a magnificent sound and a three-sided screen. I liked the posture of becoming a singer and the format of listening to his thoughts, so I fell in love with him even more. I couldn't let go of the emotion, so I bought a ticket again!
10,Saturday, thank you. It's grand from the start. On page three, it feels like you're on the spot. The singer's singing ability was the best My eyes were dry. I want to watch it again. I recommend it
10,These days, when there is depression due to COVID-19, the stormy singing ability of popular singers has relieved stress.Especially, the sense of realism that can only be felt on the screen x was so cool.The theater outing with my husband was the best in a long time.
10,Take a look. No, take a look twice It still lingers when I get home. I just want to see it if it's close
10,Thank you, Kim Hojung. It's also Kim Hojung. God's heavenly voice. I'm touched by a man with magical powers that no one can imitate Walk on flowery paths only
10,When I first experienced the ScreenX screen, the singer's singing ability to fill 270° on three sides was touching and touchingHe's a unique singer and vocalist that no one can touch. He's Tvarotti. Why is he so irritating?
10,It's a movie where everything is combined and it's moving and everyone's hard work has been warmly delivered
10,
10,
10,It was so touching.
10,The song is the best. But I'm sad that the fan meeting didn't sound too exciting. It would have been much more touching if the director had added one more moving video. I went to see the excitement of the first fan meeting, but I was surprised because it was edited so dry. You should have captured the emotion of the first concert. It would have been better if we approached it in humanities, not technically. I hope to edit it in a different direction next time. It's true that I want to see more behind-the-scenes stories.
10,I saw it twice and I want to see it againㅜㅜ The singer's voice that resonates endlessly and the voice and emotions that are different for each song were healing Thank you.
10,I've never sung a song that touches my heartIt was so touching that I criedIt's a short life as a singer, but I know how I've lived, so I'm digging into my heart as if I'm sad about the song. It was a touching time
10,I am the 18th generation descendant of the Ulsan branch of the Kim clan of Gyeongju. A man never forgets his roots. I pay attention to the consistent appearance since I was a student and not forgetting my initial intention.
10,
10,It was so pretty and nice.  I love you more than I do when I see cherry blossoms on the screen.   It was so cool singing it.  The exclamation keeps...
