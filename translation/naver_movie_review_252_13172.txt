미녀와 야수
5,I think Mulan and The Lion King are the only masterpieces in the Disney series But it was worth watching. Maybe it's because I was born in 1987, but I think the Disney series is about the prince and princess series When I was young, I liked fairy tales of princes and princesses.
3,Not as good as expected 89877 
5,The Beast's Chinese dubbing voice was sung by Jackie ChanLOL In Mulan, you took the voice of General XiangLOL
5,It's still 3D... It's Disney's new production.
6,3D is greedy
3,Too bad. 3D disappointment. Rapunzel is more memorable. It was the same as before. A movie about childhood memories.
1,There is a long way to go in 3D. Watch another movie with this money. But I recommend it if you haven't seen Beauty and the Beast.
1,It would have been better if it wasn't 3D. No need for glasses
1,I got fired!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,I slept in the middle, and the kids were funny
3,My brother wanted to see it, so I did
5,The classical music was good, but it was made in 3D, but Rapunzel seems to be more interesting
5,It's a masterpiece, but Disney, since when are you picking this kind of remake? Come back to your work!
1,All the people below me are out of control
5,It's a shame that there's no story between the two, and it's a shame that there are too many musical lines.
1,There are too many John movies with lower ratings than this.
