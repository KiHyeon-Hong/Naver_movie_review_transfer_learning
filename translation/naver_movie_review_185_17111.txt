3,I turned it off after 12 minutes. It's sloppy. As you can see from the poster, it's like a bodyguard who protects the childish girl who pretending to be pretty.
6,Except for the action, it's not that great!
1,I can't watch it because it's not fun.

5,the affectionate attraction of a couple
6,The movie was ordinary, but the beauty of palm poetry was unusual
6,Even if you parody it in Chinese way, it comes alive because of Lee Yeon-gul
5,the solid professional spirit of a simple young man
1,Looking at her face, she looks like she's grown upInnocent and about 8 points
5,If you look at it now...They can't record at the same time, so they play separately and kill people too easily

3,Action Mannerism
2,Just a look.
5,There's Lee Yeon Girl in the clumsy remake...
6,A work that was filled with the charm of palm poetry
6,Only Lee Yeon-gul shines
5,Let's just look at Lee Yeon-gul's action...

5,I've seen him as a kid, but he was just like that -_-;
2,Lee Yeon-gul is cool, but the movie itself is not good
6,I can't really hit the eye like Lee Yeon-gul's action Awesome action
