나 홀로 집에
1,Jesus Christ died on the cross, apologized for our sins, and resurrected in three days so that we could be saved Amen, repent. Heaven is near
4,A movie with surprisingly violent scenes. I remembered it as a movie that made me feel affectionate for my family, so I looked it up again, but I was a little reluctant to see the violent side.
6,
3,I've never been single before. I've been with Kevin for 30 years
5,I think the second one is more fun than the first one. The first part wasn't fun enough.

1,I already remember the lines. Let's stop, please. There's a lot more This is the last time I'm done, I'm gonna kill the solos twice
6,This is probably the most aired movie in Korea. At the time, I thought it was a little childish. It's worth seeing.
1,I say something on the real-time charts.Now the main character is almost the age to see gray hair.How long are you going to eat it?At least 30 years to go home alone?Most of all, the movie itself is so boring
3,It's just a typical entertainment movie, and it's not a movie I want to watch again
1,childishness, vanity, and loss of meaning
1,I feel like I'm going to watch this movie alone again this year ㅜㅜ I'm sick and tired of it Now
5,one of the easy comedies
6,The cuteness and exhilaration that captivates the public
6,Seeing that the main character turned into a drug, it's a pity as time goes by.
1,I've never seen such a cruel movie in my life.What a total viewer...My teeth are shaking. I'm afraid my children will see it. What's more, you're releasing a movie in Korea that stars a drug addict? That's ridiculous.For your information, I am raising a 36-month-old child.
