1,The biggest lesson of the movie is that if you have a lot of money, you can marry a girl who is a seven-year-old widower. Why do women give 10 points to this movie? Isn't it proof that Hannam is less attractive and no match than a rich old-legged snob?

1,Um... There's a lot of music It's fun
1,Roh Moo Hyun the Anno Muzzi, is aliveIt's a victory

1,The movie from 50 years ago is interesting. It doesn't mean that it's a well-made movie. Isn't it too old-fashioned? 50 years ago, your parents weren't even born, but if it's funny, it's really tacky
