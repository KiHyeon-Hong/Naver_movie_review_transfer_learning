2,I just saw it. Why is this in the 9-point range?   No way. These low-level colors
1,9 points is a bit high
1,Excessive rating~ Early 8 points is appropriate
6,The narrative that friends become enemies when they are young is somewhat obvious and distracting, but Lee Yeon-gul's unique cool action and childish, but the fun of punishing them is not bad either.
6,The content of the movie is normal, but you can see excellent martial arts acting...
6,It's an obvious story of a martial arts movie, but Lee Yeon-gul's supporting roles also play a role
6,좋아요.
6,Interesting story, not monotonous action Lee Yeon-gul
6,The action sequence at the end is always the highlight!
1,the worst
