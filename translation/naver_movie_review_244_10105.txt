1,No fun except Singing in the Rain. Let's go to La La Land one more time again.
5,I felt sorry for Rina, who was ignored due to her inherent bad voice, and I didn't like the situation that drove her into a wicked woman. Rather, Lockwood, the male protagonist who satirizes his colleague singing with him and finds only his own interests, felt mean.
1,There is no memorable scene other than Singing in the Rain.
1,The heroine is so ugly
1,I'm not in the right mood. I'm embarrassed to watch this movie on the subway
6,A cheerful tap dance. A cheerful character. I can't accept it
1,Pretty and pretty Debbie Reynolds. But in the play, Lina felt sorry for her.
5,Feel the lightness to your heart's content
4,As expected, it was an old movie, so I didn't want to listen to it because the gag code was different and the female voice was especially angry. I didn't really learn anything. But I like the white dress scene at the end The movie is cute, but I don't know.
3,It's not fun -- the heroine is so ugly that she can't get into it
6,Except for old fashion, fancy tap dancing, and famous songs, the movie itself is very ordinary.
5,I don't think musical movies are good.A movie that only revealed the dominance of the American film industry...
6,My body is up and down and cheerful, but I certainly don't think I'm cut out for a musical movie
5,I don't know
2,No comment
3,The last scene is fun
