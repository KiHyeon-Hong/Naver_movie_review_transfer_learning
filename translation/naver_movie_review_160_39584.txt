1,This is a movie
1,It sounds like a good movie, but it's not my cup of tea
5,I don't think it's a masterpiece I don't have an OST that I remember. It was not enough fun until the beginning and the middle of the story, and the story was interesting, so it was okay, but there was no feeling of deepening in the second half, and the ending was especially boring
1,It's just a movie that doesn't suit my taste
1,It's so touching
3,A masterpiece that warms my heart.
1,I wonder if there will be another movie that is not touching and worth my mother's rating. Anyway, it is boring and time-consuming
6,Music for communication purposes, not stage, no artificial setting, no emotion, a movie that only competes with the communion of music
6,It contains good contents such as education through music and the relationship between true teachers and disciples, but it is generally typical.
1,The rating is too high~~^^
6,What's 5+3? 53 This clip came out in this movie
6,It's just a time-consuming movie.

1,9.2 is ridiculous. -- It's a good movie, but everyone has a different perspective.
1,It was fun. It was really fun. I like it's a stump
1,It's such an obvious story...There's no catharsis, there's no twist.The song is worth listening to, but it's overrated
