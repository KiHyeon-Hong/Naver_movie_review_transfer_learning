5,Considering that it is a classic movie, the scale is narrow and the content seems to be very short. The people around me aren't even a sidekick
6,I watched it because it was like the same level as the one in the heaven and the rest of the world, but personally, it didn't meet my expectationsWhenever I see Lim Chung Ha, I keep making it feel like a parody of TVXQ!It's just the last scene
1,a highly rated trash movie
2,It's a total disaster. Oh, my God
3,a strange and wistful nature
3,When we ate it and ate it again and again

5,The story was fast and I didn't find it very interesting
4,Siamese twins vs gray-haired bride
6,I wish I'd seen you sooner.When will the second heyday of Hong Kong movies...
5,Memories are definitely memories A movie that makes you feel their charm
