6,The rating is very high, so it's a little boring if it's not as fun as you think (the situation is going fast and you don't understand everything) Paul Newman is too handsome to turn off the movie in the middle Ebbs Sunday Cinema I love you
6,The theme song is very good. I didn't say I was second on the phone, but am I being fooled? The brutal Ronan will try to kill two people somehow, but will they live by their own name?
1,simulated farmers, herdsmen, farmers, farmers, farmers, farmers, farmers.
1,Panama, monuments, franchisees.
1,It would have been worth watching at the time of its release, but it is far from a masterpiece beyond the times.
6,It's so famous that no one knows music better than the movie.Paul Newman and Robert Redford, who are now big stars, are also excellent
1,The OST was so good, but the movie was rather boring
5,Forty years ago, it would have been a great masterpiece at the time, but it's only a classic at this point because a lot of progress has been made based on this film. I am satisfied with the wonderful appearances of the prominent actors who cover the lead and supporting roles, and the set and props that seem to faithfully reproduce the U.S. of the 30s.
5,Maybe it's because it's an old movie, but it's boring and you can expect a twist. An area called inversion is attempted +
6,If there's a crook like this, the country will be ruined
6,a cheerful comedy
5,Maybe it's because it's so famous, but it really doesn't meet my expectations
6,The music and the twist will be talked about for a long time, but it's just too much for the villain and the enemy.
6,Compared to his reputation...
6,Maybe it was because I noticed the twist, but I saw it well, not as much as I expected.
3,I've never seen such a soft and stupid mafia in my life.
1,NAVER Body Score
5,There is no sense of immersion.
6,It wasn't as good as when we first met, but I'm satisfied with this
