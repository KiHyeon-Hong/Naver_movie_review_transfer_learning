4,It's just... It's not in the 9th grade
6,The never-ending misery of war, in which the loser is in pain and the winner is also guilty. And pain is the share of innocent people who have been ordered to fight
5,It's even more pitiful because it's a true story. It was a movie that made me keep thinking, "What's wrong with soldiers?" I don't know the Naver rating. I can't believe this movie's rating is 9.18.
6,It is good that the supplementary class films of World War II continue under the name of regional warfare, but we should make a fair evaluation compared to the masterpieces that have been made over 70 years.
1,The beautiful sea, the beach, and the children caught my eye, and the acting of the boss who melted into the movie was good, but all the rest of them were well.
6,The content itself was good but boring.
2,Moderation Aesthetics Neutralizing Cliché
6,That's too much of a rating.  So-so.
1,I'm not asking you to let me go
1,a frown of forced emotion
6,a lyrical and bland story
6,The nine-point range is manipulation. It's worth thinking about up to 7 points
